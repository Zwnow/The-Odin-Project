        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>The original recipe, upon which this one is based
            , is for "Steamed Ginger and Mushroom Chicken". 
            The recipe required a bamboo steamer and wok, 
            neither of which we had, so we decided to make our own version. 
            Same ingredients, somewhat different method. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms (dried is much preferable to fresh in this recipe)</li>
            <li>3 cups boiling water</li>
            <li>1 to 1 1/2 pounds chicken thighs, preferably bone-in, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce (use gluten-free soy sauce for gluten-free version)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar </li>
            <li>Pinch salt </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Soak the dried mushrooms in the hot water for 20 minutes. Use a bowl or a smaller pot to keep the mushrooms submerged in the water. </li>
            <li>While the mushrooms are soaking, mix the soy, sugar, salt and cornstarch in a large bowl. Make sure there are no cornstarch lumps. Add the chicken and ginger to the bowl, toss to coat with the marinade, and set aside. </li>
            <li>When the mushrooms have softened, remove from the water (saving the soaking liquid) and slice thin. Add the mushrooms into the bowl with the chicken. If the soaking water has grit in it, pour the soaking water though a fine-meshed sieve lined with a paper towel into another bowl.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken mushroom mixture, and the mushroom soaking liquid into a pot and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a bare simmer, cover the pot and cook gently for 25 minutes. Serve hot. </li>
        </ol>
